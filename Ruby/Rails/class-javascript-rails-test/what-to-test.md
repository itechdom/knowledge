### What and How

* Testing functions:
    * Similar to what we have seen in ruby and rails
    * We are testing if the output if a certain function = to what we expect
* Testing DOM:
    * If your javascript code makes changes to the DOM, how would you test that?
    * We usually check the attr in the DOM
    * We will use chai-jquery for that purpose
