#### When to use them?

* Data Processing: Generating thumbnails or resizing images.
* APIs: Interacting with a service outside of you site. Like posting tweets for example.
* Maintenance: expiring old sessions, sweeping caches.
* Email: sending an order confirmation or a notification.
* Payment processing: charging a payment.


#### Good OO makes a difference

* If you have followed the principles of Object-Oriented Programming, extracting responsibilities will be easy.
* If your controllers look like a spaghetti bowl, it will be very hard.
* If that is your problem, refactor before adding a background job.
