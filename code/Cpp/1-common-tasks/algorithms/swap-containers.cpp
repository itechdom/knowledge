// Swap the contents of two containers.
// 
// On [9-10], we create two [`std::vector`](cpp/container/vector)s
// and initialise them with values.
// 
// On [12], we swap the contents of the two `std::vector`s using the
// [`std::swap_ranges`](cpp/algorithm/swap_ranges) algorithm, which
// is given the beginning and end iterators of one range and the 
// beginning iterator of a second range. This performs an
// element-by-element swap of their values (in this case, four swaps).
// The second range must have at least the number of elements in the
// first range. After this operation, iterators remain valid and point
// at the same container as they did previously.
// 
// On [14], we use `std::vector`'s `swap` member function to swap the
// contents all in one shot. Alternatively, [16-17] perform the same
// operation with the [generic swap pattern](/common-tasks/swap-values.html).
// This approach is much faster than `std::swap_ranges`, as it simply
// swaps over the internal storage in constant time. It also does not
// require the containers to have the same size. However, after the
// operation, iterators will now point at the other container and
// past-the-end iterators are invalidated.
