// Avoid manual memory management to improve safety and reduce bugs
// and memory leaks.
// 
// Every object created on [10-14] will internally manage some
// dynamically allocated memory (allocated with the `new` keyword).
// They are all, however, implemented such that they deallocate that
// memory when they are destroyed. This practice is known as RAII.
// 
// The user of these classes does not need to perform manual memory
// management, reducing the risk of memory leaks and other bugs. In
// fact, the use of `new` and `delete` can be avoided entirely by
// using these RAII types.
// 
// Likewise, it is good practice to ensure your own classes also
// implement the RAII idiom with the
// [rule of five](/common-tasks/rule-of-five.html)
// or [rule of zero](/common-tasks/rule-of-zero.html).
